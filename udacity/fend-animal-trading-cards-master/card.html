			<p>With very ciruclar faces, white and brown feathers the barn owl is a beautiful creature of the sky. We’re used to thinking that they use a call that sounds like a twit-twoo or a hooting sound. However, this isn’t always the case. Where barn owls are concerned, the male of the species is actually more likely to make a sharp shrieking call which will last for a few seconds and be repeated several times in succession.</p>
