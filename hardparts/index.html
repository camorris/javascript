<!-- What happens when javascript executes (runs) my code? -->

<!-- Global EXecution Contexts place where my code is run as soon as the variable is made.

    Place where we can store variables and functions. Global Memory.
    Thread of Execution interacts Execution Stack (Call Stack: where we keep track of functions).

    (these two make up Global Execution Context)
-->
<script type="text/javascript">
  var num = 3;//variable of num stored in Global Memory
  function multiplyBy2(inputNumber){
    var result = inputNumber*2;
    return result;
  }
  // definig a functions
  var name = "Shno"
  var output = multiplyBy2(num);// created the variable output and evaluate multiplyBy2


multiplyBy2() // is invoking a functions
// when you execute a function you create a new execution context comprising:
//      - the thread of execution
//      - a local memory('Local Variable Environment')where anything dfined in the function is stored



  // Javascript is single threded meaning it gives ability to do synchronous execution . C++ multiple threads gives you alot of performance but is difficult more so for game development.

  // Functional Programming has two things
  //  - Pure Functions no side effects outside of the function itself
  // - 'higher order Functions' highly valuable tool & often part of the Codesmith interview
